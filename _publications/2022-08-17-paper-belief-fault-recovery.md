This project entitled testing and statistical assessment of plans which is devoted to risk assessment and assistance for plan selection in underwater AI robotics. One aspect of evaluating plans of underwater robots in high-level semantics is considering the knowledge base of the system as its beliefs. Using rule-based systems can prioritize the requirement of a system in mission-agnostic knowledge such as capabilities, goals and tasks. Due to uncertainty in such systems which interact with an unstructured environment, myself in collaboration with Jeremy P. Coffelt studied and worked on a belief-based fault recovery
